🔍 Problem Statement
Swiggy wanted insights into its restaurant ecosystem — including food preferences, delivery patterns, pricing, and ratings — to make better business decisions across cities and neighborhoods.

⚙️ Challenges Faced
- The dataset had missing values in critical fields like ratings, price, and delivery time.
- Cuisines were repeated under different names (e.g., “North Indian” vs. “Indian”).
- Some restaurant names and locations were duplicated or inconsistent.
- Too many visuals made the dashboard crowded at first.

✅ How I Solved It
- Cleaned and standardized the dataset using Excel (handled nulls, grouped cuisines, fixed duplicates).
- Used slicers and filters in Power BI for clear exploration.
- Focused visuals on key metrics like rating, price, delivery time, and top food types.

🌟 Final Outcome / Impact
- Created an interactive dashboard showing:
  - ⭐ Avg rating: 3.66 | 💰 Avg price: ₹348 | 🕐 Avg delivery: 54 mins
  - Top food types and expensive areas like Vile Parle, Brigade Road
- Helped Swiggy visualize delivery insights and pricing trends city-wise.
